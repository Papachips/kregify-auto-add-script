This script takes .tar or .7z .mp3 files from a directory, unzips them, sets metadata using Filebot and eyed3, creates directories for them and transfers them to the server. Can handle multiple albums at a time from the same artist or various artists.

Simply plug in your starting directory (directory variable) and ending directory (server variable) and run.
